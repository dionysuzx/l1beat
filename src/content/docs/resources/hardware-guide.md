This is a working document describing Kittynode hardware.

## Hardware options

### NanoPC-T6 (ARM) 

- $160: NanoPC-T6 16GB RAM
- $300: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD
- $10 (optional): Generic power supply, ethernet cable

This brings the cost to about $470.

### Minisforum UM890 Pro

- $480: Minisforum UM890 Pro
- $300: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD
- $50: 32GB of ram

This brings the cost to about $830.

### Minisforum MS-A1

- TL;DR: Kind of marketed more towards desktop users as opposed to homelabs.

## Key points

- More RAM would be nice.
- Storage is replaceable, but RAM is not.
- Upper limit of 64GB of RAM seems okay for most people (can run a lot of things).
- It's great if the device can be expanded to meet changing demands.
- No one size fits all.

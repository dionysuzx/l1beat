## Desktop

Download the latest desktop release (macOS, Windows, Linux) from the [releases page](https://github.com/kittynode/kittynode/releases).

## Mobile

If you want to be a test user for the mobile app, [join the Discord](https://discord.kittynode.io) and let us know. We can send an invite.

Otherwise, you can build the mobile app for iOS or Android yourself (see the [development guide](/development/development-guide)).

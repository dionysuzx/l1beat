## Grand vision and work streams

Kittynode has a grand vision:

1. The world should reflect the virtues of its people.
2. Control over property should be in the hands of property holders.

There are a few work streams to achieve this vision:

1. Making it easier to be a validator by reducing the financial burden (eg. Orbit SSF).
2. Making it easier to be a validator by reducing the technical burden (eg. Kittynode).
3. Initiatives that make the validator set more representative of its users.
4. Initiatives that safeguard features of the world that are in the best interest of its users.
5. Initiatives that empower users to shape the world to the best of their ability.

Kittynode is focused on all work streams to support the grand vision. Today we're focused on delivering a control center for node operators.
